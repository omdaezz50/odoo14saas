Once configured, Odoo will read the Auth SAML Providers values from the
configuration.

Note that visibility of login button for SAML is changed and differs from `auth_saml` module,
instead of relying on which fields are filled or not, all providers will be displayed as long
as their configuration in Odoo are set to active.
